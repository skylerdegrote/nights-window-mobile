            The flame flickered as the room filled with a cold breeze. Mailynn, her sister, her best friend and two
            close friends sat around the table hand-in-hand hoping that their chant would reveal something. Five candles
            spread out, one in front of each person. The lights snapped off and the candles each blew out as if by a person
            one-by-one.
            <br><br>
            "This is too much, Mailynn. I'm outa here!" The connection broke as Ayla took her hands from the magical
            circle. The light glashed back on and the room grew hotter.

            Once Upon A Time there was a small school called Hill-side High School in a small, almost invisible town called Turk.
            In this town, a family of five suffered a terrible loss. A mother, a wife. Her name was Jayden. Jayden was a fine woman; one
            that every town woman envied. She was smart, kind, and beautiful. But she also had her secrets. No one knew Jayden; not really. She
            had one particularly dark secret that not even her family knew about. It was this secret that took Jayden from her beloved family.
            <br><br>
            Jayden was not from this land we call Earth. Well...she was but not from this dimension. On her 14<sup>th</sup> birthday, little Jayden
            found a portal to a new land, a new time and a new home. This portal never completely closed. She kept it with her at all times as a
            reminder of her real home.
            <br><br>
            Her whole life...

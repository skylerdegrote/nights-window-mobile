            "The chant didn't work because not everyone believed it would. It was working until Ayla broke the
            connection. We have to try again."
            <br><br>
            "Umm...you're kidding right?"
            <br><br>
            "No Jess. We have to try again." a hint of sadness filled Mailynn's voice. "It's..." there was a long
            pause. "It's my mom." A tear rolled down her cheek. "I have to get her back."

            "Umm...Hello?" Mailynn got up onto her bare feet and brushed the rocks and dirt off her hands and
            clothes. She looked around as the air became cold and empty, "Anyone there?" She paused, "Not
            again!" She screamed out, quickly covering her mouth as the echo vibrated off the cave walls.
            <br><br>
            All alone, Mailynn explored the cave's path, leaving a trail of x's in the dirt along the way.

            "Wait a second!" There was a slight pause and a moment of realization. "You're Jayden." Another
            pause as Jay looked at Mailynn with raised brows, "as in Jayden Cooper?"
            <br><br>
            "No. My last name is Selston. Jayden Ann Selston. Who is Jayden Cooper?" Jay asked as they both
            walked across the yard of fake plants and trees.

        <div class="post-body">
            "Ummm...excuse me?" Her voice shaky, Mailynn got up from where she was thrown to, "Excuse me, Sir?" she
            paused, turned around, "Ma'am?" No one even blinked in her direction.
            <br><br>
            <span class="italicText">What am I supposed to do? How do I even know if I'm in the right place?</span>
            Her thoughts were running wild, like they had nothing holding them back anymore. Mailynn used to stop
            herself from thinking things that her friends thought were crazy. She thought maybe if she held them
            back, then she would stop believing them. But in this world, Mailynn couldn't control her thoughts. Her
            head pounded as they all came forth.
            <br><br>
            Mailynn jumped back suddenly. Leaning forward towards a bush, Mailynn thought she saw someone watching her.
            <br><br>
            "Pst! Pst!" a voice tried to get her attention.
            <br><br>
            "Hello?" Mailynn tip toed towards to the bush, "Who is there?" Mailynn screamed as a hand pulled her
            through the bush and she fell to the grassy floor.
            <br><br>
            "Would you be quiet!" the girl said softly but sternly. She wasn't any older than fourteen years old.
            <br><br>
            "Who are you?" Mailynn whispered back.
            <br><br>
            "The name's Jay. Short for Jayden. Where did you come from?" She had a ver odd accent. Mailynn couldn't
            quite figure out where it was from.
            <br><br>
            "I'm from Turk. Where am I?" Mailyn looked all around her. Surrounded by trees and flowers, "Are we in a
            garden?" Mailynn stood up slowly and peaked over the bush she was pulled through, "Is this fake?" she
            said, stroking the bush gently. She pulled back her hand as she got poked with the pointy pine on the
            tree next to her.

            "I always noticed that mom carried a small mirror with her. Though, she never used it as a mirror."
            <br><br>
            "Why'd she have it then?" Jess asked, swinging her long blond hair behind her right shoulder.
            <br><br>
            "I don't know..." Mailynn trailed off into thought.

            "Aperi ad locum Tasilan" Maiylnn chanted these four foreign words three times just like the book had
            described, with a picture of her mother in the middle of a circle of white candles. The flames grew
            higher and Mailynn backed away. The connection broke. Suddenly Mailynn was launched back and into a tree.
            When she came to, she was no longer by the bookstore she so dearly loved.

            <div class="dottedBox">
                My name is Mailynn. Mailynn Addison Cooper. I'm the daughter of Steven and Jayden Cooper. I have a sister
                (Stephanie Ann Cooper) and two brothers (Colton Douglas Cooper and Martin Adam Cooper. My mother was
                taken from us but she's alive, I just know it! I believe she was taken to a different world. I believe
                she was taken back home. No one believes me, not even Jess. I'm writing this note because I don't know
                when or if I will be coming back. I think the world I'm going to is called Tasilan. I read about it in a
                book I found in a mythical-reading bookstore at the mall. If I do find a way back to Turk, I'm bringing
                my mother home with me. I'm not leaving there without her!
            </div>
            <br><br>
            Mailynn placed the ripped paper on the front step of the bookstore, under a rock. She hoped it would be
            found eventually. Maybe whoever found it would believe her.

            The flame flickered as the room filled with a cold breeze. Mailynn, her sister, her best friend and two
            close friends sat around the table hand-in-hand hoping that their chant would reveal something. Five candles
            spread out, one in front of each person. The lights snapped off and the candles each blew out as if by a person
            one-by-one.
            <br><br>
            "This is too much, Mailynn. I'm outa here!" The connection broke as Ayla took her hands from the magical
            circle. The light glashed back on and the room grew hotter.

        <div class="post-body">
            Once Upon A Time there was a small school called Hill-side High School in a small, almost invisible town called Turk.
            In this town, a family of five suffered a terrible loss. A mother, a wife. Her name was Jayden. Jayden was a fine woman; one
            that every town woman envied. She was smart, kind, and beautiful. But she also had her secrets. No one knew Jayden; not really. She
            had one particularly dark secret that not even her family knew about. It was this secret that took Jayden from her beloved family.
            <br><br>
            Jayden was not from this land we call Earth. Well...she was but not from this dimension. On her 14<sup>th</sup> birthday, little Jayden
            found a portal to a new land, a new time and a new home. This portal never completely closed. She kept it with her at all times as a
            reminder of her real home.
            <br><br>
            Her whole life...

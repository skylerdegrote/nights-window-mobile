                    Once Upon A Time there was a small school called Hill-side High School in a small, almost
                    invisible town called Turk. In this town, a family of five suffered a terrible loss. A mother, a
                    wife. Her name was Jayden. Jayden was a fine woman; one that every town woman envied. She was
                    smart, kind, and beautiful. But she also had her secrets. No one knew Jayden; not really. She
                    had one particularly dark secret that not even her family knew about. It was this secret that
                    took Jayden from her beloved family.
                    <br><br>
                    Jayden was not from this land we call Earth. Well...she was but not from this dimension. On her
                    14<sup>th</sup> birthday, little Jayden found a portal to a new land, a new time and a new home.
                    This portal never completely closed. She kept it with her at all times as a reminder of her real
                    home.
                    <br><br>
                    Her whole life, Jayden never really truly fit in. She always felt that pull to go back to her own
                    dimension. But one day, this new land she ran off to as a girl, showed he a path to happiness. A
                    path her homeland would never have been able to give her.
                    <br><br>
                    "Forgive me, my lady, for being so blunt. But your smile truely lights up this entire room." the
                    strange mn bowed. Jayden stiffled a blushed laugh as she bowed back to the man, "My name is
                    Steven, what shall I call you, miss?"
                    <br><br>
                    "You may call me Jay," her smile grew as her cheeks became rosey again, "Short for Jayden."
                    <br><br>
                    Jayden and Steven fell in love and had such plans for a large family. But Jayden had not revealed
                    her secret to him. She was afraid he would leave her and tell everyone she was crazy. After
                    having their second daughter, and expecting twin boys,Jayden feared it was too late to tell the
                    truth. He would leave and probably take the kids with him. The truth was, she had been lying to
                    him from the start. She was living a lie. No one she cared about, no one in this realm, knew
                    where she really cam from.

                    <br><br>
                    This story is about Mailynn, Jayden and Steven's second child, discovering her mom's true history
                    and believing in the ways of her mother's land. With optimism and hope at her side, Mailynn may
                    just find a way to bring her mother back. All she needs is for someone to believe as much as she
                    does.

                    <br><br>
                    "Mailynn! This is crazy!"
                    <br><br>
                    "Jess, this will only work if we all believe that it will. You have to at least try. Please?"
                    Mailynn paused, "If it was your family that was missing, I would help you."
                    <br><br>
                    The two ladies joined their friends at the table. It had been exactly one year since Jayden was
                    taken from her family. Mailynn and her friends, sat around the kitchen table at her childhood
                    home, hand-in-hand.

                <div class="chapterBody">
                    The flame flickered as the room filled with a cold breeze. Mailynn, her sister, her best friend
                    and two close friends sat around the table hand-in-hand hoping that their chant would reveal
                    something. Five candles spread out, one in front of each person. The lights snapped off and the
                    candles each blew out as if by a person
                    one-by-one.
                    <br><br>
                    "This is too much, Mailynn. I'm outa here!" The connection broke as Ayla took her hands from the
                    magical circle. The light glashed back on and the room grew hotter.

                    The cave walls started to close in on her as she sank to the dirt floor and tears rolled down her cheeks.
                    <br><br>
                    "Mailynn?" a voice echoed off the rock walls, "Mailynn, are you in here?" Mailynn rose to her feet and
                    scurried around the cave, trying to find where the voice was coming from.
                    <br><br>
                    "Who is there?" Mailynn's voice shook as the words escaped past her lips.

                    “May, I’m sure he is fine. He’s just hiding. He’s just scared.” Jess tried to calm her best friend down.
                    <br><br>
                    Silence filled the air, “Jess, that doesn’t make any sense. Sure he was scared so he probably hid, but
                    where is he now?” Mailynn looked into Jessica’s eyes, “Did you hear what he said before he disappeared?”
                    She shook her head. “He said, ‘it’s here’ and he sounded so scared!"
                    <br><br>
                    Jessica hesitated, “I’m sure he was just trying to scare you…” she didn’t believe her own words. There
                    was a brief pause.
                    <br><br>
                    “It’s the mirror!” a thought jumped into Mailynn’s head.
                    <br><br>
                    “What is?”
                    <br><br>
                    Mailynn ran down the hall of her little brothers’ school, Hill-side High, and out the front door.
                    <br><br>
                    “Mailynn! Wait! We have to wait for Colton!” Jessica stood alone in the hall as the last bell of the day
                    rang and all the students scurried out of the classrooms, rushing to their buses.

                <div class="sceneBody">
                    Once again, the five friends joined hands at the table with candles in front of each of them.
                    Mailynn was determined to make this chant work. The flame flickered in the dark room as Mailynn's
                    breath became more abrupt. The white candle was glowing, the wax turning to a color of power and
                    aggression. Excitement and worry filled Mailynn's heart as she saw the effects of the words they
                    repeated.
                    <br><br>
                    The room filled with an unfamiliar air. A cold breeze surrounded the group. Mailynn heard a
                    whisper.
                    <br><br>
                    "It's here." Marty, Mailynn's 14 year old brother, whispered with a tint of fear in his voice.
                    Mailynn opened her eyes and glanced around the kitched of her childhood home.
                    <br><br>
                    "Marty?" Mailynn yelled out. He wasn't there but she still felt his hand in hers. The connection
                    broke as everyone opened their eyes, "Marty? Where are you? This isn't funny Marty! Mailynn's
                    voice turned from frightened to annoyed. As a faint, terrified scream responded, Mailynn jumped
                    out of her chair and scrambled all over the room, the house; No Marty.
                    <br><br>
                    The lights snapped on and she saw it. There it was just hanging on the wall like it belonged
                    amongst the decor. The small mirror that Jayden carried with her wherever she went filled
                    everyone with the sense of fear and dread. The day Jayden died, it hung itself on the wall, and
                    any time it appeared out of thin air, someone either dies or disappears with no explanation.
                    <br><br>
                    "Guys...I think we need to get out of here!" Jess suggested quietly.
                    <br><br>
                    "I'm not leaving without Marty!" Mailynn ran around the room again.
                    <br><br>
                    "May, that mirror is back. You know what that means. We need to go!" Jess tried to pull Mailynn
                    with her by the elbow. Mailynn tugged back.
                    <br><br>
                    "He's my brother, I can't just leave without him!" Mailynn insisted. Jessica pulled on Mailynn's
                    arm harder, dragging her out the door with the rest of the group.

                    <br><br>
                    "No Jess. We have to try again." a hint of sadness filled Mailynn's voice. "It's..." there was a long
                    pause. "It's my mom." A tear rolled down her cheek. "I have to get her back."

                    "Umm...Hello?" Mailynn got up onto her bare feet and brushed the rocks and dirt off her hands and
                    clothes. She looked around as the air became cold and empty, "Anyone there?" She paused, "Not
                    again!" She screamed out, quickly covering her mouth as the echo vibrated off the cave walls.
                    <br><br>
                    All alone, Mailynn explored the cave's path, leaving a trail of x's in the dirt along the way.

                    "Wait a second!" There was a slight pause and a moment of realization. "You're Jayden." Another
                    pause as Jay looked at Mailynn with raised brows, "as in Jayden Cooper?"
                    <br><br>
                    "No. My last name is Selston. Jayden Ann Selston. Who is Jayden Cooper?" Jay asked as they both

                    "Ummm...excuse me?" Her voice shaky, Mailynn got up from where she was thrown to, "Excuse me, Sir?" she
                    paused, turned around, "Ma'am?" No one even blinked in her direction.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="italicText">What am I supposed to do? How do I even know if I'm in the right place?</span>
                    Her thoughts were running wild, like they had nothing holding them back anymore. Mailynn used to stop
                    herself from thinking things that her friends thought were crazy. She thought maybe if she held them
                    back, then she would stop believing them. But in this world, Mailynn couldn't control her thoughts. Her
                    head pounded as they all came forth.
                    <br><br>
                    Mailynn jumped back suddenly. Leaning forward towards a bush, Mailynn thought she saw someone watching her.
                    <br><br>
                    "Pst! Pst!" a voice tried to get her attention.
                    <br><br>
                    "Hello?" Mailynn tip toed towards to the bush, "Who is there?" Mailynn screamed as a hand pulled her
                    through the bush and she fell to the grassy floor.
                    <br><br>
                    "Would you be quiet!" the girl said softly but sternly. She wasn't any older than fourteen years old.
                    <br><br>
                    "Who are you?" Mailynn whispered back.
                    <br><br>
                    "The name's Jay. Short for Jayden. Where did you come from?" She had a ver odd accent. Mailynn couldn't
                    quite figure out where it was from.
                    <br><br>
                    "I'm from Turk. Where am I?" Mailyn looked all around her. Surrounded by trees and flowers, "Are we in a
                    garden?" Mailynn stood up slowly and peaked over the bush she was pulled through, "Is this fake?" she
                    said, stroking the bush gently. She pulled back her hand as she got poked with the pointy pine on the
                    tree next to her.

                    "Ostende mihi viam ut Tasilan" Maiylnn chanted these foreign words three times just like the book
                    had described, with a picture of her mother placed in the middle of a circle of white candles. The
                    flames grew higher and Mailynn backed away. She thought the connection broke. Suddenly Mailynn was
                    launched back and into a tree. When she came to, she was no longer by the bookstore she so dearly
                    loved.

                        My name is Mailynn. Mailynn Addison Cooper. I'm the daughter of Steven and Jayden Cooper. I
                        have a sister (Stephanie) and two brothers (Colton and Martin). My mother was taken from us
                        but she's alive, I just know it! I believe she was taken to a different world. I believe
                        she was taken back home. No one believes me, not even Jess. I'm writing this note because I
                        don't know when or if I will be coming back. I think the world I'm going to is called
                        Tasilan. I read about it in a book I found in a mythical-reading bookstore at the mall. If I
                        do find a way back to Turk, I'm bringing my mother home with me. I'm not leaving there
                        without her! Dad, if you are reading this note, I really hope you can forgive me.

                        found eventually. Maybe whoever found it would believe her.

                    "Wait a second!" There was a slight pause and a moment of realization. "You're Jayden." Another
                    pause as Jay looked at Mailynn with raised brows, "as in Jayden Cooper?"
                    <br><br>
                    "No. My last name is Selston. Jayden Ann Selston. Who is Jayden Cooper?" Jay asked as they both
                    walked across the yard of fake plants and trees.

                    "Ummm...excuse me?" Her voice shaky, Mailynn got up from where she was thrown to, "Excuse me, Sir?" she
                    paused, turned around, "Ma'am?" No one even blinked in her direction.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="italicText">What am I supposed to do? How do I even know if I'm in the right place?</span>
                    Her thoughts were running wild, like they had nothing holding them back anymore. Mailynn used to stop
                    herself from thinking things that her friends thought were crazy. She thought maybe if she held them
                    back, then she would stop believing them. But in this world, Mailynn couldn't control her thoughts. Her
                    head pounded as they all came forth.
                    <br><br>
                    Mailynn jumped back suddenly. Leaning forward towards a bush, Mailynn thought she saw someone watching her.
                    <br><br>
                    "Pst! Pst!" a voice tried to get her attention.
                    <br><br>
                    "Hello?" Mailynn tip toed towards to the bush, "Who is there?" Mailynn screamed as a hand pulled her
                    through the bush and she fell to the grassy floor.
                    <br><br>
                    "Would you be quiet!" the girl said softly but sternly. She wasn't any older than fourteen years old.
                    <br><br>
                    "Who are you?" Mailynn whispered back.
                    <br><br>
                    "The name's Jay. Short for Jayden. Where did you come from?" She had a ver odd accent. Mailynn couldn't
                    quite figure out where it was from.
                    <br><br>
                    "I'm from Turk. Where am I?" Mailyn looked all around her. Surrounded by trees and flowers, "Are we in a
                    garden?" Mailynn stood up slowly and peaked over the bush she was pulled through, "Is this fake?" she
                    said, stroking the bush gently. She pulled back her hand as she got poked with the pointy pine on the
                    tree next to her.

                    "Why'd she have it then?" Jess asked, swinging her long blond hair behind her right shoulder.
                    <br><br>
                    "I don't know..." Mailynn trailed off into thought.

                    "Aperi ad locum Tasilan" Maiylnn chanted these four foreign words three times just like the book had
                    described, with a picture of her mother placed in the middle of a circle of white candles. The
                    flames grew higher and Mailynn backed away. The connection broke. Suddenly Mailynn was launched
                    back and into a tree. When she came to, she was no longer by the bookstore she so dearly loved.

                        My name is Mailynn. Mailynn Addison Cooper. I'm the daughter of Steven and Jayden Cooper. I have a sister
                        (Stephanie Ann Cooper) and two brothers (Colton Douglas Cooper and Martin Adam Cooper. My mother was
                        taken from us but she's alive, I just know it! I believe she was taken to a different world. I believe
                        she was taken back home. No one believes me, not even Jess. I'm writing this note because I don't know
                        when or if I will be coming back. I think the world I'm going to is called Tasilan. I read about it in a
                        book I found in a mythical-reading bookstore at the mall. If I do find a way back to Turk, I'm bringing
                        my mother home with me. I'm not leaving there without her!

                    Mailynn placed the ripped paper on the front step of the bookstore, under a rock. She hoped it would be
                    found eventually. Maybe whoever found it would believe her.

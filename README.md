# Night's Window
### Blog and Website for my Live-Writing project
#### This is the mobile-friendly version using Bootstrap
Only the website is mobile friendly at the moment

This will probably turn into another series, but will be written live with ideas from everyone whom chooses to
participate. Please see disclaimer at the bottom of the site and blog.

I'm writing my third book live so the world can contribute if they would like to. While doing this,
I'm also coding the blog and website for it so I can make it my own creation.

Please follow and like my pages!

Right now I have the following image representing me as my profile image on these sites. This is not original art and
 is not my image. I will be replacing this google image with my own eventually.

###Parts of the website that I have so far:
#### Home Page
Right now I'm trying to gain a community and followers. Eventually this page will be used as an overview of the book
#### Characters Page
Character Cards with basic information about each character in the book so far. Each of these link to another page
with more detail about that character.
#### The Individual Character Pages
These are blank at the moment. Hoping to get some feedback and ideas from people around the world
#### Chapters Page
Each chapter has it's own section on this page. These are available for receiving feedback. Please send all of your
ideas to me via the contact page
#### Scenes Page
Need some ideas.
#### Quotes Page
Need some ideas.
#### Ideas Page
Need some ideas.
#### Contact Page
Please send your ideas through this form. They are sent to my email and I review them before posting. You have the
option of requesting me to inform you if your idea/feedback has been posted. Use this form for feedback on the pages
of the website, the blog and the book itself.
#### The Blog
The blog is its own part of the website. This is where all the feedback and ideas will be posted first. I also plan
to post any new additions to the site to the blog. Users can use the form at the bottom of the blog to make any
comments on any particular idea or post. I will post everything to the blog before I add it to the website.

#### Some of the spells/incantations used in the story and their meaning
